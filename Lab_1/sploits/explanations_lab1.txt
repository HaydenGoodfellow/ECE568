Target 1: This target was vulnerable to a simple buffer overflow attack. To 
accomplish this I used GDB to find the return address and the buffer start 
address. I then allocated the arg for the target to be the difference of those 
addresses (+ 5B for padding). Then I filled it with the buffer address and 
inserted the shell code at that address at the start of the buffer.
